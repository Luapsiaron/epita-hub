    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
    My project is EPITA Hub, a collaborative web platform designed to help students at EPITA, my engineering school in France. The aim is to better manage academic work and teamwork. The idea came from the way our studies are organized: we often work on demanding group projects, especially during periods known as “pools” (9am to 11pm weeks of intensive, high-pressure coding). These times can be chaotic, and having all the tools in one place would make things easier.
    </p>
    <p>
    The platform is designed to bring together key services that students typically use separately, with the aim of improving organization, communication and visibility within teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Main features include:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Project management</strong> – A task-tracking area enabling teams to assign responsibilities, meet deadlines and visualize progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared calendar</strong> – To follow class schedules, deadlines, and project deliverables, with automatic reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Team chat</strong> – A real-time messaging space where students can discuss, share files, and stay in touch throughout their projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring dashboard</strong> – A visual overview of key technical information, like server status or how many student teams have submitted a given assignment.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      All these services will be integrated into a single cloud-hosted website, allowing students to access everything they need from one place. The platform aims to be simple, efficient, and adapted to real student needs.
    </p>

    <h2>License</h2>
    <p>
      I have chosen the MIT License for this project because it is simple, permissive, and ideal for open-source academic work. It allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the code, even for commercial purposes, as long as proper credit is given. This promotes collaboration and encourages future students or institutions to reuse and improve the platform. The MIT License is widely used and compatible with most free software components.
